# Improving Navigation-Based Internal links for SEO  

The way you structure and organize internal links plays an important role in how both users and search engines are able to navigate your website, ultimately impacting your website’s rankings.

Search engines like Google use links to crawl the web. The crawlers click on each link that appears on a page ( both internal links and external links ) and then all the links on each subsequent page, and so on. This allows the search engines to find your pages and rank them in their indices.

For this reason, the way you link the pages on your website plays a big role in how search engines crawl, understand and rank your site. How do you make sure your site architecture is optimal and that internal links are organized correctly? Let’s explore how calculating a metric I call Internal PageRank can help us with this task.

# Basic site architecture and navigation-based internal links 

There are two basic types of internal links: 
1. The internal links that form your site’s navigational structure 
2. The secondary internal links that appear in context throughout your site.
